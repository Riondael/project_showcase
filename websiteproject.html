            <h3>Why was this created?</h3>
            <p>This website was created as an example of the skills I have developed over the years of learning to be a software developer.</p>
            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>I am a college student from Oklahoma, and I have been coding since the release of Minecraft 1.7.2!</p>
            <p>I know that seems weird, and it is! My first introduction to coding was through Minecraft adventure maps because I loved created my own experiences within the game!</p>
            <p>My first knowledge of programming was learned through Minecraft command blocks! LOL!</p>
            <p>Since then, I have learned many programming languages and have created many projects!</p>
            <p>Feel free to check out my projects on the <a href="index.html">Project Showcase</a> page!</p>
